# [Paweł Trojański's Portfolio Website](https://envigit.github.io/)

## Description
Welcome to my personal portfolio website. This project showcases my skills as a **Junior Technical Implementation Specialist**, **Unity Developer**, and **Cybersecurity student**.

The website has been recently refactored to focus on performance, clean code, and a modern "dark mode" aesthetic. It features a custom-built digital resume, dynamic project showcases, and interactive UI elements—all built without heavy frameworks to ensure maximum speed and responsiveness.

## Key Features
- **Modern & Clean Aesthetics:** A professional dark-themed design focused on readability and user experience.
- **Performance First:** Completely removed jQuery in favor of lightweight **Vanilla JavaScript**.
- **Interactive UI:**
  - **Direction-Aware Buttons:** Hover effects that track mouse movement direction.
  - **Custom Cursor:** A smooth, trailing cursor animation implemented in pure JS.
  - **Scroll Spy Navigation:** A dynamic marker in the navigation bar that follows the active section.
- **Scroll Reveal Animations:** Sections and project cards animate into view using the **Intersection Observer API** for high performance.
- **Digital Resume / Timeline:** An interactive timeline section detailing my experience and education history.
- **Responsive Design:** Fully optimized layout for desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5** (Semantic structure)
- **CSS3** (Flexbox, CSS Variables, Animations, Media Queries)
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** (DOM Manipulation, Logic, Animations)
- **Typed.js** (Typewriter effect for the hero section)
- **Font Awesome** (Social and contact icons)

## Sections
1.  **Home:** Hero section with a dynamic typewriter effect.
2.  **About:** Professional bio, and skills list.
3.  **Timeline:** A vertical timeline showcasing my career path and academic background.
4.  **Projects:** A gallery of my recent work with links to live demos and repositories.

# [Paweł Trojański's Portfolio Website](https://envigit.github.io/)

## Description
Welcome to my personal portfolio website.

The website has been recently refactored to focus on performance, clean code, and a modern "Cyber/Tech" aesthetic. It features a custom-built digital resume, dynamic project showcases, and interactive UI elements - all built without heavy frameworks to ensure maximum speed and responsiveness.

## Key Features
- **Modern & Clean Aesthetics:** A professional design with a toggleable **Light/Dark Mode** system based on CSS variables.
- **Performance First:** Completely removed jQuery and external animation libraries in favor of lightweight **Vanilla JavaScript**.
- **Interactive UI:**
  - **Direction-Aware Buttons:** Hover effects that track mouse movement direction to create a fill animation.
  - **Context-Aware Cursor:** A custom single-dot cursor with blend-mode effects that reacts to links, images, and text (smart contrast).
  - **Scroll Spy Navigation:** A dynamic marker in the navigation bar that follows the active section.
  - **UX Enhancements:** Back to Top button, custom toast notifications, and Click to Copy email functionality.
- **Advanced Animations:** - **Text Scramble Effect:** A custom-written, cybersecurity-themed text decoding animation.
  - **Scroll Reveal:** Sections animate into view using the **Intersection Observer API**.
  - **Live Counters:** Animated number counters for the Stats section.
- **Digital Resume / Timeline:** An interactive vertical timeline with a progressive filling line.
- **SEO & Accessibility:** Fully optimized with JSON-LD Schema, Open Graph tags, and keyboard navigation support.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5** (Semantic structure, SEO meta tags)
- **CSS3** (Flexbox, CSS Variables, Keyframe Animations, Media Queries)
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** (DOM Manipulation, Logic, Canvas API, Intersection Observer)
- **Font Awesome** (Social and contact icons)

## Sections
1.  **Home:** Hero section with a custom "Hacker Scramble" text effect.
2.  **About:** Professional bio, categorized skills list, and downloadable CV.
3.  **Timeline:** A vertical, interactive timeline showcasing my education and career path.
4.  **Stats:** Animated counters highlighting experience, certifications, and projects.
